# Introduction
This wordclock is based on a STM32WB55CEU6 mikrocontroller placed on a custom printed ciruit coard.
It is designed using the STM32CubeIDE without LL oder HAL Driver, just CMSIS.
It is strongly encapsulated in classes and written in C++.
This project only provide a pcb and the software. An encloser has to be designed by yourself.
You have to solder the LEDs directly on the pcb and no strips are needed. You can use SK6812 (**strongly** recommended since WS2812 are not testet and debugged **yet**) or WS2812.

On the PCB are three capacitive touch sensores. The mikrocontroller provides the possibillity to use internal touch sensores but I choosed to use MTCH105 instead. The sensores are placed directly in cupper.

The STM32WB55CEU6 provides the possibility of BLE connectivity on chip. The antenna is implemented on the PCB but **not tested** yet. There is also no app programmed yet and no support implemented in the firmware yet. Feel free to contribute this. 
The wordclock is designed to work without external tools like apps or remote control. The goal is that every functionality can be configured using the cap keys of the clock and an app should only be optional and should not deliver additional possibilities.

Of course you can use any DCF77 modul you want. But the PCB is designed to use the following module: https://de.elv.com/dcf-empfangsmodul-dcf-2-091610

  * maybe: __replacing STM32WB55 with different generic mikrocontroller and addid wifi with external component__
  * maybe: WIFI support

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues
Implemented but not tested yet:
* English screen
* WS2812 support

PCB:
* touch keys affect each other sometimes


# üíæ Layouts
For every language there is a .svg file in the project. The font used is Source Code Pro Semibold. The .svg files have the right spaces between the chars and dots, but pay attention to the size and position of the frame and hidden elements. The .svg files are meant to use for plotters.

**Attention: Every front has a '¬∞C' on the last line in __one__ char place! In the tables below it takes __two__ places!**

# PCB
The pcb is designed in KiCad. All librarys for symbols and footprints are dilivered with the project and there are no libs used diretly from the KiCad installation.
Each LED has a 100nF capacitor but since there is a very big GND and +5V plane I never used or needed them. Nonetheless it is **recommended** to equip them.

The board size is 370x370mm. The distances of the LEDs are:
* LED -> PCB edge: 50mm
* LED -> LED (x axis): 27mm
* LED -> LED (y axis): 30mm
